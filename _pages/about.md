"Genetics & Genomics `|` Life Science analytics `|` Strategy Consulting `|` Digital Health"

I’m a healthcare analyst with a background in genetics and bioinformatics, combined with global strategy consulting experience across pharmaceutical and life sciences markets. My work spans go-to-market strategy, market intelligence, pricing, and product positioning, helping teams translate complex data into insights that drive impactful commercial decisions.

I specialize in turning research and market insights into actionable strategies that help innovative therapies reach the patients who need them most. By blending scientific depth with business strategy, I bridge the gap between emerging technologies and real-world clinical adoption—particularly within the rapidly evolving digital health space.

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, I’m passionate about how digital health is reshaping care delivery, improving outcomes, and redefining the patient experience
