Over the past four years, I’ve been working in the life science, healthcare, and pharmaceutical sectors. To apply my industry knowledge and experience to real-world product design, I initiated a self-directed side project focused on Ubie, a symptom checker app. Ubie allows users to input symptoms and connects them to online doctor consultations, an “Ask Doctor” forum, and detailed disease information.
This case study examines Ubie, a symptom checker platform with doctor consultations and community forums, where I identified and designed solutions for improving user navigation.

## What is Ubie? (Product overview)

**Ubie** is a **digital health app** that combines symptoms checker + online consultation + medical Q&A forum answered by qualified doctor. Its core function is a **symptom checker.** I intend to understand how well does this symptom checker app in helping patients to identify the right disease and right specialist to see.

Unlike many community-based health forums, Ubie ensures medically sound answers by using a verified doctor panel.

## Who are the user behind that would benefit from this the most? (Target user)

Ubie addresses a common healthcare access problem as traditional clinic visits don’t work for everyone. The app targets two distinct user groups facing barriers in seeking care:

1. **Time-constrained users** include busy professionals juggling work demands, parents managing young children, and elderly or rural residents with limited access to medical facilities. These people usually face difficulty to visit in-person during clinic hours, and need healthcare solutions that fit their schedules and physical limitations
2. **Decision-uncertain users** represent a second critical group - people experiencing symptoms but unsure whether it warrants a hospital visit or which speci-list to consult. For these users, Ubie’s symptoms checker together with Ask Doctors forum provide crucial guidance before they commit time and resources to in-person consultation

These two user segments tie to two key services/ monetization route in Ubie - online consultation and Ask Doctor forum.

## How does Ubie make money? (Business model)

Ubie’s core feature is symptom checking, which leads to its two main monetization route. 

The first is **online consultation**, which acts like usual clinic visits, via online consultation, and covers everything from doctor appointment down to getting your prescription drug at your doorstep, and this insurance-reimbursable. This is a per session fee-for-service.

The second one is **Ask doctor medical forum**, where users can ask health queries anonymously and get answers from qualified doctors. This can either be done through pay per usage or choose a monthly subscription.

Online consultation app is not something new, with other apps that are in market longer and/ or with more users such as Clinic, Curon, sokuyaku etc. However, Ubie’s Ask doctor forum is something new and is a unique offering. Typical patient forum online tend to be information sharing among patients, but Ubie’s ask doctor forum provides an extra layer of reassurance/ trusted second opinion since it is coming from accredited/ verified doctor.
